# Laravel Nepal Content Repository

This is the **content repository** for [Laravel Nepal](https://github.com/Laravel-Nepal).  
All community-contributed content lives here in Markdown files. The Laravel Nepal website pulls data from this repo.

## How It Works
- Each content type has its own folder (`authors`, `posts`, `projects`, etc.)
- Every folder contains a `README.md` with its own contribution guide.
- To contribute:
    1. Fork this repo
    2. Create a new file in the correct folder
    3. Follow the format in the folder’s `README.md`
    4. Submit a Pull Request

✅ After your PR is merged, your contribution will be visible on [laravelnepal.com](https://laravelnepal.com).

## Folders
- [authors/](authors/README.md) → Profiles of contributors
- [companies/](companies/README.md) → Companies in Nepal using Laravel
- [packages/](packages/README.md) → Laravel packages by Nepali devs
- [posts/](posts/README.md) → Blog articles & tutorials
- [projects/](projects/README.md) → Showcase of community projects

## Contribution Guidelines
- You must have a profile in `authors/` to contribute to other folders.
- Keep content **relevant to Laravel & the Nepali community**.
- Use proper **frontmatter** as shown in each folder’s `README.md`.
- PRs should contain only one new/updated file per contribution.
- Be respectful and follow open-source etiquette.
