# Authors

This folder contains profiles of community contributors.

## File format
- One file per author â†’ `username.md`
- Use Frontmatter for metadata.

## Profile picture guideline

- Use a solid square image (PNG or JPG).
- Recommended size: 1000x1000px.
- Place logos in the `/images/profile` folder. The file name must be same as the `username` field.
- In case you didn't upload a profile picture, the system will use [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) based on your email.
